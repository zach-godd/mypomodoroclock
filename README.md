This is a Pomodoro Clock application. Pomodoro clocks are countdown timers used for 20 minute intervals coupled with 5 minute breaks inbetween to maximize productivity in any given day.

This project was inspired by a React tutorial from https://upmostly.com/tutorials/build-a-react-timer-component-using-hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
